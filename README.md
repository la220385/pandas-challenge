# PyCitySchools Analysis

# Module 4 Challenge Description
In this project, as the Chief Data Scientist for a school district, we aim to analyze district-wide standardized test results to help the school board and the mayor make strategic decisions. The analysis uses datasets containing students' math and reading scores along with school-level data, including school budgets and student demographics.

# The main tasks include:
- Aggregating data to showcase trends in school performance.
- Grouping and analyzing data by various criteria, such as per-student budget, school size, and school type.
- Providing a detailed summary of district-wide performance and specific school-level statistics.

# Data Sources
1. # Attract Document:
   - The provided starter file, PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb served as the main source for guidance on how to use Pandas for data manipulation, from creating DataFrames to calculating statistics.
2. # Pandas Documentation:
   - The Pandas library is extensively used for data manipulation and aggregation tasks. The official documentation is an essential reference. You can access it at: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
3. # Jupyter Notebook:
   - This webpage https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ guided me on creating notebooks, running code cells, formatting text with Markdown, and integrating visualizations.
4. # Python:
   - https://docs.python.org/3/ aided in using python syntax, built-in functions, and libraries in Jupyter Notebook. 

# Summary of analysis & two observable trends:
1. # Summary
   -This project analyzes district-wide standardized test results to help guide strategic decisions regarding school budgets and academic priorities. The analysis focuses on key performance metrics such as average math and reading scores, passing rates, and overall school performance, categorized by school size, budget per student, and school type.
2. # School Performance and Budget:
   - Schools with lower per-student spending (below $585) tend to perform better in math and reading compared to schools with higher per-student spending. This observation suggests that increasing spending does not necessarily correlate with better student performance.
3. # School Size and Passing Rates:
   - Smaller schools (fewer than 1,000 students) generally show higher passing rates in both math and reading, as well as higher overall passing percentages. On the other hand, larger schools (2,000+ students) tend to have lower passing rates. This may suggest that smaller student populations allow for more individualized attention, contributing to better performance outcomes.
